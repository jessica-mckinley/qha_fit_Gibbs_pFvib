# qha_fit_Gibbs_pFvib
A MATLAB script which accepts energies, frequencies, temperature, and pressure as inputs. Will compute the Gibb's free energy for each given temperature and pressure using the Quasi-harmonic approximation. A double-Murnaghan equation of state fit is performed on the Gibbs energies and the Helmholtz vibrational energies are fitted with a polynomial function of degree 5.
